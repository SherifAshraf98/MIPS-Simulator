# MIPS-Simulator
This project simulates the MIPS processor, taking in binary instructions, and shows each register values at the end of each instruction.</br>

This was a collaboration of 5 students: Ahmed AlSai, Sherif Ashraf, Ahmed Mamdouh, Ahmed ElQaffas and Amr Badawi.<br/>

Note: This was an old project and was made without using Git, so the quality is not assured.
